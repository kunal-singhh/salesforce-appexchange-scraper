Sure, here are the steps to set up this project in Python 3:

Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in the terminal/command prompt:

mkdir salesforce-appexchange-scraper
cd salesforce-appexchange-scraper
Create a new virtual environment for your project:

python3 -m venv env
Activate the virtual environment:
On macOS/Linux:


source env/bin/activate
On Windows:


env\Scripts\activate.bat
Install the required packages using pip:
Copy code
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
Create a new Python file scraper.py and copy the sample code into it.

Run the scraper script using the command:

Copy code
python scraper.py
This should start the scraping process and print the extracted information for each developer to the console. You can modify the code to save the data to a file or a database if needed.

Once you're done, deactivate the virtual environment:
Copy code
deactivate
That's it! Let me know if you need any further assistance.
